[2023.03.16] Ignore everything below and just download the zip.


Idk why would you even try this out

But if you do make a folder in the folder where you have these .py files called "SnakerNumberOne" otherwise it won't work

Place the "Highscores.txt" file into the "SnakerNumberOne" folder

Inside the "SnakerNumberOne" folder create a new folder called "Sounds"

Add the "Munch.mp3" file in the "Sounds" folder

or just download the release version ...02
