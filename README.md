Idk why would you even try this out

but if you do make a folder in the folder where you have these .py files called "SnakerNumberOne" otherwise it won't work

place the "Highscores.txt" file into the "SnakerNumberOne" folder

inisde the "SnakerNumberOne" folder create a new folder called "Sounds"

Add the "Munch.mp3" file in the "Sounds" folder
